## Abstract
This paper examines avian magnetoreception sensory mechanisms and their implications for navigational behaviors focusing on migratory birds' ability to navigate back to a "home point" using geomagnetic cues. We integrate biophysical models of magnetoreception into a neural network designed to simulate avian navigation by downscaling the task onto a 2-dimensional plane. Two primary receptors are explored: the "compass" receptor in the retina, which operates via a radical pair mechanism sensitive to specific light and magnetic field conditions, as well as the magnetite-based receptor in the upper beak, functioning as a magnetometer to provide magnetic field strength cues. The neural network created here employs these inputs to determine the return heading from a randomly generated location on the plane towards a predesignated home point. Methods include the generation of a synthetic 2-dimensional magnetic field, a winner-take-all synapse action model demonstrating efficacy of reorientational behaviour in the presense of adequate light, and finally a trained neural network model that functions to provide the 'direct to home' heading from the simulated avian sensory inputs. Results indicate that the model can effectively learn and mimic a simple navigation strategy, pointing to significant potential for further research into more biologically accurate neural models and their applications in understanding complex navigational systems in birds.
